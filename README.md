    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

The project uses environment variables for configuration.

1.  **Frontend:** In the `/frontend` directory, create a file named `.env.local` and add the following, pointing to your local backend server's address:
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
    ```

2.  **Backend:** In the `/backend` directory, create a file named `.env` and add any necessary server-side variables.
    ```
    # Example .env for backend
    PORT=8080
    # Add database connection strings, API keys, etc.
    ```
